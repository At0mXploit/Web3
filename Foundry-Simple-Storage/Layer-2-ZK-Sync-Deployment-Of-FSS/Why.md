# Why?

## Layer 2 (L2)

* Network built **on top of Ethereum**
* Makes transactions **faster and cheaper**
* L1 (Ethereum) = secure but slow/expensive
* L2 = fast, low-fee, still inherits Ethereum security

## zkSync

* A **Layer 2 solution** using **zero-knowledge proofs**
* Batches transactions to reduce gas fees
* Keeps Ethereum-level security
* Used for DeFi, NFTs, and testing contracts

## Alchemy

* Blockchain infrastructure provider
* Gives **RPC endpoints** to interact with Ethereum/L2
* Runs nodes so developers don’t have to
* Provides APIs and analytics for apps

* Ethereum = main chain
* L2 = faster, cheaper layer on top
* zkSync = specific L2 solution
* Alchemy = service to connect apps to blockchain easily
